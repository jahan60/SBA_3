## Joke Builder web page
Project Overview: this project is a a simple joke builder web page includes JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, and browser behavior.

## The page allows users to:
1. Enter a joke setup and punchline
2. Validate input before submission
3. Add jokes to the page dynamically
4. Show or hide the punchline
5. Delete individual jokes
6. Scroll back to the top of the page smoothly

## How this page works:
1. The user types a joke setup and a punchline into a form.
2. When the user leaves the setup input, the app checks if it’s long enough.
3. When the form is submitted:
    -The page does not refresh.
    -The app validates both inputs.
    -If the input is invalid, an error message is shown.
    -If valid, the joke is added to the page.
4. Each joke appears as its own box containing:
    -The setup text
    -A button to show or hide the punchline
    -A delete button to remove the joke
5. The punchline is hidden by default and toggled using a button.
6. A “Back to Top” button scrolls the page smoothly to the top.
7. Console logs are used during development to track execution and behavior.
